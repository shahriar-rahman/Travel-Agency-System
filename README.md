# **Travel Agency System**
A website designed for the convenience of clients traveling with the best tourist services across the world.

## Abstract 
The general concept of this web application is to ensure convenience for tourists by providing easier accessibilities and possible options while encouraging the clients to use the endorsed product, by offering simple and effective site navigation, discounts, and so forth. The site not only allows the customer to purchase airway tickets but also offers various hotel reservations in the specific location where the user is planning to stay. This product is primarily intended for those who would like to visit a particular place and would like user-friendliness guidance to help them settle in their desired trip location. Moreover, it would offer a lower cost while also accommodating and quickly responding to any difficulties the customer experiences during their visit.


## Product Scope
The purpose of this proposed web application is to ease flight management and to create a convenient and easy-to-use application for users. The system is based on a relational database with its flight management and reservation functions. We will have a database server supporting hundreds of major cities worldwide and thousands of flights by various airline companies. This system can prove to be immensely useful for travelers and travel agents with little to no management facilities. The system will provide the necessary information about the available flights in that certain place where the user wants to travel with the time and hotels pre-booking system. Requirements statements in this document are both functional and non-functional and, above all, the main purpose is to provide a comfortable user experience along with the best available pricing.


## Characteristics of General Users:
• They must have a device (i.e. laptop, mobile, etc.), internet facility, and browser for browsing websites.
• They need to be educated enough to know how to navigate the site and have experience in online shopping or service.
• They should have an idea about booking flights and hotels. • They must have a credit card to purchase the services provided.

## Characteristics of Admin:
• They must-have devices, internet facility, and browser. Without any one of these, the admin won’t be able to perform. They also need to be skillful in some programming languages for building web pages.
• They must have experience in any type of management skills.
• They must know how to fix bugs while changing or adding any features.
Even they must know to add or remove any features.
• They must possess proper communication skills or a least have customer servicing experience.

## Operating Environment
The website is expected to be hosted on an open-source cross-platform web server called XAMPP Server, allowing for easier and extremely fast web 
migration as the web server is expected to run on a virtual machine. Due to the web nature of the system, it allows better compatibility with any type of operating system with internet access and at least one web browser. Furthermore, with Mozilla Firefox being one of the most used browsers in the world, the primary derivative is to prioritize optimum compatibility and efficient optimization procedure toward the usage of the specified browser.

## Constraints
The difficulties in developing such a system include the virtualization of airways and hotel services for a specific country. The user might wish to visit somewhere which is not present in the system database. Thus, the addition of locations, airways, and hotel reservations can be challenging for an admin to fulfill the user’s request, especially when the demand for such a trip to those countries is very low.
Moreover, security is not a primary concern for this system. The database may store passwords in plain text and the password recovery feature may not
be present nor lockout after numerous invalid login attempts. As a result, the system may not work properly in terms of security.
